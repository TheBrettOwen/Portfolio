Task 1: I'm not happy with how the oriented_edges function came out, because angles that aren't 90 or 0 keep edges at both of those orientations and I can't understand why. \

Task 2: The function was written assuming the oriented_edges function works properly, but I'm almost certain that if I hadn't screwed up Task 1 it'd work great.
