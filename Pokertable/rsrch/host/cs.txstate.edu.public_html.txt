The web app we are creating can be hosted under one of our indvidual txstate university cs linux
server accounts under the public_html directory. There must be an entry point html file called
index.html. All files in public_html must have r permissions in the other group, and all other
directories need to have r-x permissions in the other group. The site url follows this format
'cs.txstate.edu/~NETID'. The rules for hosting on your student public_html web page can be found
at 'https://cs.txstate.edu/resources/labs/accounts/linux/'.
